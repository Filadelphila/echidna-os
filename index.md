# Welcome to EchidnaOS Page

EchidnaOS is an *x86 operating system* developed for my personal *learning*.

## How I learn

The main resource I use to learn is **["Programmer son propre noyau : une introduction avec PÃ©pin"](http://a.michelizza.free.fr/pmwiki.php?n=TutoOS.TutoOS)** but I use too **[OSDev](https://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page)** and a lot of **others resources** on the world wide web.

## Programming languages

The main language of the project is *C++*. This project also use *GNU assembler* for the multiboot2 header file.

## Compile the project

For compiling the project you need to compile tools like explain in *[this webpage](https://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler)*.
It's not a big deal but you may have to change some Makefile variable to be able to compile the project.
After that, simply run
    make
    
## What can do the operating system

Nothing so far.
